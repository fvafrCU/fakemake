# Introduction
There are 
[many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_build_automation_software)
[build systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_automation), 
and more uses for build systems [see @powers2002, sections 11.10 and 11.11].

I have been using the 
[unix make utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)) when 
developing R packages since 2012. But sometimes I get caught on a machine where 
*make* is not available and where I am not entitled to install it. This is why I 
wrote *fakemake*: to build an R package conditionally on the modification times
of (file) dependencies without having to rely on external software. 
If you have any proper build system at hand: stick to it, do not use *fakemake*.
