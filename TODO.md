- write a test for tryCatch!! The example runs, the test (tried testthat as
  well) crashes...!
- make uses eval(parse(text = )). Isn't there a better way?
- remove/add standard root and path for target output?
- add a touch(path) function copying files to tempdir() and conditionally on
  file.mtime() bach to path
